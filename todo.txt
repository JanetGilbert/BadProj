Grading Guide and TODO list.

* Submit the project via pull request.


Grade D:

There is a compiler warning in BlobStateMoving.cs. Fix it and explain (in a comment) what the problem was, and what effect it had on the game. 

"score" is currently a private variable in the GameController class. GameController has a public function AddScore() which adds a number to score. Refactor AddScore to be a public property called "Score" which allows you to change or access the score. Remember that properties should be used like variables rather than functions.

Grade C:
Replace the Quintic easing function in BlobStateShrinking with a Quartic easing function.

Bug: You can set the blob to "Shrinking" multiple times by clicking on it multiple times. Fix this bug so that the blob can't be set to Shrink while already in the Shrinking state.

Grade B:
Add an extra state to the Blob state machine called BlobStateBlinking. In this state, the blob should blink on and off with a delay of half a second between blinks. This state should be entered after BlobStatePulsing, and return to the BlobMoving state after 2 seconds. 

Override the Leave() function in BlobStateBlinking to add 1 point to the score every time a blob leaves the Blinking state.

Grade A:

Merge Working1 and Working2 branches into Start. Resolve the conflicts with the lines marked "Good"

Implement the selection sort algorithm in the RemoveHighestBlobs() function in the GameController class.
